# AgenticOdyssey Getting Started

This repository contains a workshop scenario for identifying early lifecycle risk in high-value customers (VIP/Gold) and taking practical retention actions.

## Workshop Demo Flow (Start Here)
Follow this end-to-end order:
1. **Copilot Studio** (build/configure + conversational insight): build/configure the Level 300 copilot artifacts, then identify at-risk VIP/Gold customers and draft plain-language explanations/actions.
2. **Foundry** (structured scoring): use New Foundry navigation (**Build -> Data**, **Build -> Workflows**) to run the 4-agent chain, enforce `tier='VIP' AND recency_days > 60`, and keep the 2+ negative-signal at-risk rule.
3. **Agent Framework** (build/configure + proactive demo): build/configure the Level 300 alert workflow, then generate explain-only alerts for at-risk VIP/Gold customers.

## First-Time Onboarding
1. Open the learner guide: `docs/customer-lifecycle/learner-guide.md`.
2. Run the labs in order:
   1. `labs/customer-lifecycle/level-300/copilot-studio.md`
   2. `labs/customer-lifecycle/level-300/foundry.md`
   3. `labs/customer-lifecycle/level-300/agent-framework.md`
3. Keep `labs/customer-lifecycle/level-300/output-contract.md` open while working; this is the grading baseline.

## Returning Learner Fast Path
If you have already completed orientation:
1. Go directly to `labs/customer-lifecycle/level-300/copilot-studio.md`.
2. Complete Level 300 outputs per `labs/customer-lifecycle/level-300/output-contract.md`.
3. Use `labs/customer-lifecycle/level-400/extensions.md` only after L300 is complete.

## Learning Levels and Pass/Fail Boundary
Canonical definitions (aligned with shared docs):
- **L100 (foundational orientation):** Understand scenario context, data sources, and shared vocabulary. No pass/fail completion gate.
- **L200 (intermediate):** Build practical familiarity with the tools and data shaping approach before the graded baseline.
- **L300 (advanced hands-on baseline, WWL-aligned):** Advanced hands-on practice that builds on L100 and L200; this is the required workshop exercise level for completion/pass.
- **L400 (optional complexity):** Extension work that deepens L300 outcomes; enrichment only and excluded from pass/fail.

Pass/fail boundary:
- **Pass requires L300 completion.**
- **L400 is optional and must not affect pass/fail.**
- If in-class scope must be cut, move non-essential items to `labs/customer-lifecycle/level-400/extensions.md` as after-class extensions (do not delete them).

## Level 300 Required Output Checklist
Your Level 300 submission must include:
1. At-risk VIP/Gold identification using the **2+ negative-signal rule**.
2. Plain-language explanation for each at-risk VIP/Gold customer.
3. Recommended human action for each at-risk VIP/Gold customer.
4. Portfolio summary:
   - Tier counts
   - At-risk counts
   - At-risk % by tier
